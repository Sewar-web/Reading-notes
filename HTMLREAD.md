#  ***HTML5 Layout***

# HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.

 **Headers & Footers**
 The header and footer
elements can be used for:

● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.

● A header or footer for an
individual article or
section within the page.


**Navigation**
The nav element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

**Articles**
The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.

**Article**

The aside element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an article
element or not.
When the aside element
is used inside an article
element, it should contain
information that is related to the
article but not essential to its
overall meaning. For example, a
pullquote or glossary might be
considered as an aside to the
article it relates to.
When the aside element is
used outside of an article
element, it acts as a container
for content that is related to
the entire page. For example,
it might contain links to other
sections of the site, a list of
recent posts, a search box, or
recent tweets by the author.

**Sections**
he section element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

**Heading Groups**
The purpose of the hgroup
element is to group together a
set of one or more h1 through
h6 elements so that they are
treated as one single heading. 

**Figures**
It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images). 


# Process and Design
# This section discusses a process that you can use when you are creating a new website.

It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.


**Site maps** allow you to plan the structure of a site.


**WireFrames**

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

 You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
 
 You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
