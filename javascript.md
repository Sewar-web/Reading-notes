# **JavaScript**

## **What is a script ?**

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

**JavaScript** is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name in JavaScript : 
1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number. 

2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name. 

3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something.


4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. 

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word. 




## ***Assigning a value to a variable*** 

*var VariableName=value;*

The value could be iteger, floate,list,boolean and string.



## **If statment** 
The IF statement executes one set of code if a specified condition is met (TRUE) or another set of code evaluates to FALSE.

if (condition)

{     
executes this if the condition met

}

else 

{

executes this if the condition did'nt met

}


## **prompt function**
Prompt()

Allows the user to input anything>
