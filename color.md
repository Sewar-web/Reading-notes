# Color

The color property allows you
to specify the color of the web page elements.


## Color theory

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very
closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them).

When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not
emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture.

The color of every pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue â€”
just like on a television screen.


**You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three way:**

**1 . rgb values.**

These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90).

**2 . hex codes.**

These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

**3 .color names.**

There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan.



## Background Color

You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors.
